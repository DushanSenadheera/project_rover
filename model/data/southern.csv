This strategic emporium of foreign trade has ancient roots, possibly dating back to biblical times as the city of Tarshish. Legend has it that the town derived its name from a Portuguese fleet's accidental encounter, inspired by the crowing of a cock ('Galo' in Portuguese), or possibly from the abundance of rocks ('Gala' in Sinhala) in its harbor."
